# RetroSwipe

This is a game I built in my unity game development course, summer 2021, through MasteryCoding.

it works like a candy crush type game. You have n swipes (shown by clock icons) in which to 
a) accumulate the indicated number of coins (necessary to pass the level)
b) achieve the highest score possible

you can exchange the positions of two adjacent gems, clocks, or coins in any of the 8 horiz/vert/diag directions.

Matching 3 or more clocks will give you that many more swipes.

Matching 3 or more of any other element will add to your score and remove the items from gameplay.

Good luck!
